## Algorithms

## December 01 – Perfect Squares Counter

### Problem Statement
```

You are a mathematician exploring numbers. You are given a range of integers from 1 to N. Your task is to find all the perfect square numbers in this range and calculate their total count.
• A perfect square is an integer that can be written as the square of another integer.
• For example, 1, 4, 9, 16 are perfect squares.
```

### Input Format:
```
• A single integer N (1 ≤ N ≤ 10⁵), representing the upper bound of the range.
```
### Output Format:
```
• First, print all the perfect squares in ascending order, separated by spaces.
• Then, in the next line, print the total count of perfect squares.
```

### Sample Input 1
```
20
```

### Sample Output 1
```
1 4 9 16
4
```

### Sample Input 2
```
5
```

### Sample Output 2
```
1 4
2
```

### Explanation

```
• For N = 20, the perfect squares are 1²=1, 2²=4, 3²=9, 4²=16 → total count = 4.
• For N = 5, only 1²=1 and 2²=4 are perfect squares → total count = 2.
```

#### Constraints
```
1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5
1 ≤ array[i] ≤ N
All elements are unique
```

## December 02 - Total of Distinct Values

#### Problem Statement

```
The Data Standardization Team needs a utility to display a sequence of integers in four
different numerical bases in a clean tabular format.

You are given an integer N. For every number i from 1 to N, you must print four different
representations of i:

1. Decimal (Base 10)
2. Octal (Base 8)
3. Hexadecimal (Base 16) — letters A–F must be uppercase
4. Binary (Base 2)

The output should display all four formats in aligned columns.
```

### Example 1:

```
Input:
3

Output:
    1     1     1     1
    2     2     2    10
    3     3     3    11
```

### Example 2:

```
Input:
6

Output:
    1     1     1      1
    2     2     2     10
    3     3     3     11
    4     4     4    100
    5     5     5    101
    6     6     6    110
```

#### Constraints
```
1 ≤ N ≤ 99
```
#### Explanation

```
For every number from 1 to N, the program converts the value into:
- Octal using base-8 representation
- Hexadecimal using base-16 (A–F in uppercase)
- Binary using base-2

These converted values are then printed in four neatly aligned columns,
allowing easy comparison between different number systems.
```

### December 03 - Bridge Crossing Challenge

#### Problem Statement

```

You are an explorer standing at the start of a series of stepping stones across a river. Each stone is numbered from 0 to N-1. Each stone has a number written on it, which tells you the maximum number of stones you can jump forward from that stone.

Your goal is to reach the last stone.

From stone i, if the number is 3, you can jump to stone i+1, i+2, or i+3.
If the number is 0, you cannot jump forward from that stone.

You need to determine whether it is possible to reach the last stone from the first stone.

```

#### Input Format

```

An array of integers stones, where stones[i] indicates the maximum jump length from stone i.

```

#### Output Format

```

true if you can reach the last stone, otherwise false.

```

#### Sample Input 1

```

stones = [2,3,1,1,4]

```

## December 06 - Magic Square of Odd Order

#### Problem Statement

```
You are given a positive odd integer n (1, 3, 5, 7, …). Your task is to generate a magic
square of order n × n.

A magic square is a grid filled with numbers from 1 to n² such that:
- Every row,
- Every column, and
- Both main diagonals
have the same sum, known as the magic constant (M).

The magic constant for an odd-order magic square is:
M = (n(n² + 1)) / 2

If the user enters an even value for n, the program should output:
"Magic square is only possible for odd values of n."
```
### Input Format:
```
Enter the value of n (order of the magic square): An odd integer.
If n is odd, compute M and construct the magic square.
If n is even, display the error message.
```
### Output Format:
```
If n is even:
Magic square is only possible for odd values of n.

If n is odd:
Magic constant: M
<n × n magic square grid>
```
### Sample Input 1:
```
Enter n: 5
```
### Sample Output 1:
```
Magic constant: 65
9   3  22  16  15

```
### Sample Input 2:
```
Enter n: 6
```
### Sample Output 2:
```
Magic square is only possible for odd values of n.
```

### Constraints:
1 ≤ n ≤ 99
n must be odd to generate a magic square


#### Explanation

```
A magic square of odd order is constructed using the Siamese method:
- Start from the middle of the top row.
- Place numbers 1 to n², moving up-right each time.
- If the cell is occupied or goes out of bounds, move down one cell instead.
```

## December 07 - Baseball Score Record Keeper

#### Problem Statement

```
You are keeping track of scores in a baseball game using unusual rules. You begin with an
empty score record. A series of operations modify this record:

- A number x → add this score to the record.
- "+" → add a score equal to the sum of the previous two scores.
- "D" → add a score equal to double the previous score.
- "C" → remove the previous score.

After all operations are applied, compute the total sum of the final record.
```
### Input Format:
```
An array of strings 'operations', where each element is "C", "D", "+", or an integer string.
```
### Output Format:
```
A single integer — the total sum of scores after all operations.
```

### Example 1:

```
Input:
ops = ["5","2","C","D","+"]

Output:
30
```

### Example 2:

```
Input:
ops = ["5","-2","4","C","D","9","+","+"]

Output:
27
```

#### Constraints

```
1 ≤ operations.length ≤ 1000
Each operation is "C", "D", "+", or an integer string in [-30000, 30000]
"+" always has at least two previous scores
"C" and "D" always have at least one previous score
```

#### Explanation

```
The operations modify the score list step by step, and finally the sum of
all valid scores is computed.
```

## December 17 - Racing Turtles

#### Problem Statement

```
You are organizing a turtle race along a straight track with n turtles.
Each turtle has a starting position and a speed. Turtles cannot overtake but can join a slower turtle ahead to form a fleet.
Compute the total number of distinct turtle fleets that will reach the finish line.
```

### Input Format

```
- target: integer, the finish line position
- n: integer, number of turtles
- position: array of n integers, starting positions of turtles
- speed: array of n integers, speeds of turtles
```

### Output Format

```
- Print "The number of turtle fleets is: <value>" if one or more fleets reach the finish line.
- Print "No turtle fleets formed." if n = 0.
```

### Sample Input 1

```
target = 10
n = 1
position = [3]
speed = [3]
```

### Sample Output 1

```
The number of turtle fleets is: 1
```

```

### Sample Output 3

```
The number of turtle fleets is: 1
```

### Constraints

```
- 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^5
- 0 ≤ position[i] < target ≤ 10^6
- 1 ≤ speed[i] ≤ 10^6
```

### Explanation

```
The problem requires counting how many separate groups of turtles (fleets) arrive at the finish line.
Turtles can join fleets if they catch up to slower turtles ahead, otherwise they form a new fleet.
```

## December 18 - Mirror Necklace Check

#### Problem Statement

```
A jeweler is inspecting a necklace made of beads, where each bead has a number engraved on it. 
The beads are strung in a single chain, and the jeweler wants to check if the necklace is symmetric — 
meaning the sequence of numbers reads the same from left to right and from right to left.

A necklace is considered mirrored if the bead numbers form a palindrome. 
Your task is to determine whether a given necklace is mirrored.
```

### Input Format

```
1. An integer N — the number of beads in the necklace.
2. N space-separated integers — the numbers engraved on each bead, in order from the first to the last bead.
```

### Output Format

```
- Print "The necklace is mirrored." if the sequence forms a palindrome.
- Print "The necklace is not mirrored." if it does not.
- Print "The necklace is empty." if N = 0.
```

### Sample Input 1

```
N = 5
Beads = 1 2 3 2 1
```

### Sample Output 1

```
The necklace is mirrored.
```

### Sample Input 2

```
N = 4
Beads = 10 20 20 30
```

### Sample Output 2

```
The necklace is not mirrored.
```

### Sample Input 3

```
N = 0
```

### Sample Output 3

```
The necklace is empty.
```

### Explanation

```
The necklace sequence is checked from both ends:
- Forward sequence: 1, 2, 3, 2, 1
- Backward sequence: 1, 2, 3, 2, 1
- Since the sequences match, the necklace is mirrored.
```

### Constraints

```
- 0 ≤ N ≤ 10^5
- Bead values are integers in the range [-10^6, 10^6]
```

## December 20 - Tower Visibility Challenge

#### Problem Statement

```
A city has a row of N towers, each with a certain height. A tower can “see” the next taller tower to its right.

You are given an array heights[] where heights[i] represents the height of the i-th tower.

For each tower, determine the height of the first taller tower to its right. If there is no taller tower to the right, record -1 for that tower.
```

### Input Format

```
1. An integer N — the number of towers.
2. N space-separated integers — heights[0], heights[1], ..., heights[N-1].
```

### Output Format

```
Print N integers separated by spaces — the height of the first taller tower to the right for each tower, or -1 if none exists.

```
5
13 7 6 12 10
```

### Sample Output 2

```
-1 12 12 -1 -1
```

### Explanation

```
For each tower, we look for the first taller tower to its right:
- Tower 0 (height 4) → next taller tower is 5
- Tower 1 (height 5) → next taller tower is 25
- Tower 2 (height 2) → next taller tower is 25
- Tower 3 (height 25) → no taller tower → -1
- Tower 4 (height 7) → no taller tower → -1
- Tower 5 (height 6) → no taller tower → -1

## December 21 - Efficient Parcel Sorting

#### Problem Statement

```
A delivery company needs an efficient way to sort parcels by their weights. The sorting machine processes parcels one by one and can perform two operations:

1. Move Front to Back (Rotate): Move the parcel at the front of the queue to the back of the queue.
2. Pick and Place: Remove the lightest parcel currently in the queue and place it in a sorted output list.

You must simulate the sorting process performed by the machine and display the final sorted list of parcel weights in non-decreasing order. The goal is to use the minimum number of rotations to achieve the sorting, following the exact behavior of the described machine.
```

### Input Format

```
- First line: An integer N — the number of parcels.
- Second line: N space-separated integers — the weights of the parcels.
```

### Output Format

```
Print the sorted list of parcel weights after performing the required operations.
```

### Sample Input 1

```
5
4 2 1 5 3
```

### Sample Output 1

```

```

### Sample Input 3

```
6
6 5 4 3 2 1
```

### Sample Output 3

```
1 2 3 4 5 6
```

### Explanation

```
The queue simulates selection sort using rotations:

- Always find the lightest parcel in the current queue.
- Rotate the queue to bring the lightest parcel to the front.
- Pick the parcel and place it in the sorted output.
- Repeat until the queue is empty.
```

### Constraints

```
1 ≤ N ≤ 10^4
1 ≤ weight ≤ 10^5
Expected Time Complexity: O(N²) or better
Expected Space Complexity: O(N)

## December 31 - Sudoku Solver

### Problem Statement

```
Write a program to solve a Sudoku puzzle by filling the empty cells. The Sudoku must follow these rules:

- Each of the digits 1-9 must occur exactly once in each row.
- Each of the digits 1-9 must occur exactly once in each column.
- Each of the digits 1-9 must occur exactly once in each of the 9 3×3 sub-boxes of the grid.
- The '.' character indicates empty cells.
```

### Input Format

```
- A 9×9 grid where each cell contains a digit 1–9 or '.' for empty cells.
```

### Output Format

```
- Print the completed Sudoku grid as a 9×9 matrix.
```

### Sample Input

```
5 3 . . 7 . . . .
6 . . 1 9 5 . . .
. 9 8 . . . . 6 .
8 . . . 6 . . . 3
4 . . 8 . 3 . . 1
7 . . . 2 . . . 6
. 6 . . . . 2 8 .
. . . 4 1 9 . . 5
. . . . 8 . . 7 9
```

### Sample Output

```

# FAQ

#### Who can join the Challenge?

Anyone who is passionate about coding and can dedicate a little time a day for the challenge for the next 31 days.

#### When should I submit the pull request?

You don't need to submit it everyday. Just submit it once you're done with all 31 algorithms.

#### What if I'm not able to code every day?

Not a problem. While coding every day is nice, we understand that other commitments might interfere with it.

Plus its holiday season. So you don't have to solve one problem every day.

Go at your own pace. One per day or 7 a week or even all 30 in a day.

#### What language should I use to code?

Anything! New to GoLang? Best way to practice it.

Wanna find out what all this hype about Python is? Use it!

Any and all languages are welcome.

Maybe you could try using a different language for every problem as a mini-challenge?

#### Fork? Pull request? What is all that? I don't know how to use GitHub!

If you are new to Git or GitHub, check out this out [GitHub](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/)

#### How should I complete these programs?

We have a folder for each day of the month. Simply complete your code and move the file into that folder.

Be sure to rename your file to the following format:  `username_problemname`
Example:
`exampleUser_probname.py`


**Please do not modify any existing files in the repository.**

#### I forked the repository but some problems were added only after that. How do I access those problems?

Not to worry! Open your nearest terminal or command prompt and navigate over to your forked repository.

Enter these commands:

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/SVCE-ACM/A-December-of-Algorithms-2024.git
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/main
```

If you're curious, the commands simply add a new remote called upstream that is linked to this repository. Then it 'fetches' or retrieves the contents of the repository and attempts to merge it with your progress.
Note that if you've already added the upstream repository, you don't need to re-add it in the future while fetching the newer questions.

#### I received a merge error. What do I do?

This shouldn't happen unless you modify an existing file in the repository. There's a lot of potential troubleshooting that might be needed, but the simplest thing to do is to make a copy of your code outside the repository and then clone it once again. Now repeat the steps from the answer above. Merge it and then add your code. Now proceed as usual. :)

#### I'm facing difficulties with/need help understanding a particular question.

Open up an [issue](https://github.com/SVCE-ACM/A-December-of-Algorithms-2021/issues) on this repository and we'll do our best to help you out.
